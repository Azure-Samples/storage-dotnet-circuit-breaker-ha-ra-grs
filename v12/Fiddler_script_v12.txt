/*THIS FIDDLER SCRIPT ACTS TO SIMULATE FAULTS IN THE PRIMARY REGION
Open Fiddler. 
Go to Rules > Customize Rules.
Search for the OnBeforeResponse method. Add the commented-out code below.
Make sure the hostname is YOURSTORAGEACCOUNTNAME.blob.core.windows.net,
replacing YOURSTORAGEACCOUNTNAME with the name of your storage account. 
Start the app, then download the blob to see that it reads from the primary region.
Then uncomment the if clause to intercept the response and return a 503 error when the blob is downloaded again.
The script change below must be commented out when you first run the application.
